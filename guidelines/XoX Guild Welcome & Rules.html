    <h1>Welcome to Guild XoX 🎉</h1>
    <p>We’re excited to have you join <strong>Guild XoX</strong> in <strong>Hero Wars</strong>! Please review the following guidelines to ensure smooth teamwork and enjoyable gameplay.</p>

    <h2>1. Guild War Attack Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Our guild currently operates Guild War using a free attack format. Based on solid defensive strength, members are free to choose their targets and attack at their preferred time using their own judgment.
      However, this doesn’t mean we encourage completely random target selection. We do provide strategic guidelines to help with target prioritization.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capture priority: Bridge → One of the three gates → Citadel → Remaining fortifications</li>
      <li>Recommended target order based on capture bonuses:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>+120 bonus: Citadel</li>
          <li>+60 bonus: Bridge, Gates of Nature, Bastion of Fire, Bastion of Ice, Spring of Elements, Foundry</li>
          <li>+40 bonus: Barracks, Mage Academy, Lighthouse</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Once we reach the endgame with over 700 capture points, we should focus on easier targets to maximize additional capture bonuses.</li>
      <li><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If you’re short on time, make sure to use all your attacks by finding a suitable opponent, regardless of the priority order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Clash of Worlds Attack Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On the first and second day of battle, attacks will be assigned by the Guild Leader and carried out in sequence.</li>
      <li>Once all gates leading to the Citadel are cleared, or if attacking intermediate gates is deemed ineffective, the remaining attacks may proceed in a free-attack format based on priority.</li>
      <li>If the opposing guild’s gates are too difficult to break through, free attacks may also be allowed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Raid Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Teams with lower CP are encouraged to attack on Friday (the first day raids open) to secure the 10M damage reward.</li>
      <li>For advice on team composition or strategy, please use Guild Chat to ask questions and share information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Adventure Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each member is encouraged to complete at least one adventure per day.</li>
      <li>Keep your Portal Charges at 2 or fewer to ensure you receive the daily bonus charge.</li>
      <li>Any member who ignores communication or is reported for trolling two or more times during adventures may be expelled from the guild.</li>
    </ul>

            Recommended map priority (easiest → hardest):<br>
            Cleaver map (Stage 12) → Orion map (Stage 11) → Galahad map (Stage 9).<br><br>
            Ginger map (Stage 10) can be tedious regardless of experience, so raiding is often used to avoid it.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h2>5. Inactivity, Warnings, and Expulsion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Long-term inactivity without prior notice may result in removal from the guild without warning.</li>
      <li>If unavoidable circumstances prevent you from logging in, please inform the guild officers in advance.</li>
      <li>Failure to participate in guild activities will trigger notifications, and repeated warnings will lead to expulsion.</li>
      <li>New members who are expelled for inactivity during their initial period will be restricted from rejoining.</li>
      <li>Members expelled for trolling in adventures will be restricted from rejoining.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Note</h2>
